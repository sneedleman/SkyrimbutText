# SkyrimbutText
This is a Python-based text RPG game set in a fantasy world where magic is real, non-human intelligences exist, and the player must confront a powerful antagonist. The game is inspired by open-world RPGs like Skyrim, featuring decision-making and quests. Players can explore a randomized map, engage in encounters and interact* with NPCs.
